# Reinforcement_Learning

The four jupyter notebooks have different Reinforcement Learning algorithms for different Environments such as Maze, Cartpole, BlackJack
### 1. Baseline_And_AC:
#### -> REINFORCE with Baseline (Value function for advantage) with neural network policy approximation to solve the Maze problem
#### ->  Implemented AC Methods with NN approximators for both actor and critic to solve the Maze problem

### 2. First_Visit_MC:
#### -> Incremental First-visit Monte Carlo Policy Evaluation on OpenAI Gym BlackJack-V0
#### -> Policy Iteration and incremental first-visit MC to solve the following GridWorld environment

### 3. Q_Learning: 
#### -> Implemented Q_Learning algorithm for Black Jack 

### 4. SARSA_NN:
#### -> Implemented n-step SARSA with neural network function approximation to solve the Maze problem.

### 5. Cart_Pole:
#### -> Implemented DQN for open ai Cart Pole environment
